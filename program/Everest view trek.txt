From Namche we trek out of the village and follow a small trail high above the Dudh Kosi River, where the views are incredible - behind to the west, the ridge of Nupla and Kwangde Himal (6,194m); across the valley to the south, the towering ice walls of Thamserku (6,623m), and to the east at the head of the valley, the Lhotse and Nuptse wall, towering a full 3,500m above the valley at Dingboche. Everest looms above the ridge, a black, triangular rock. Sagarmatha, "Goddess Mother of Earth", is a truly magnificent sight. On a small ridge across the valley, the monastery of Thyangboche can be seen, a small speck against the gigantic mountain background. We descend to Khunjung a small Sherpa village. Here tourism has hardly changed the life of the Sherpa's. Maybe you will take the opportunity to sample the Sherpa speciality, Riki Kur - a type of potato fritter enriched with yak butter. The afternoon is left free to assist with further acclimatization. 

In the morning we descend to the village of Shanasa and on to Trashinga where the trail drops steeply to cross the Dudh Kosi at Phukitenga (3,250m). In the late morning we climb steeply before the trail levels out to ascend gradually towards Tengboche. It is a steady ascent of approximately 2 Â½ hours through pine fir, black juniper and rhododendron forest. Tengboche is set in a beautiful meadow, high on a ridge surrounded by towering Himalayan peaks. A peaceful, tranquil position the Thyangboche Monastery is a wonderful sight, spectacularly situated.
